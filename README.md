# Business-Analytics-on-Gold
Welcome to the Business Analytics on Gold repository. This project involves performing market basket analysis, building recommendation systems (Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering), and conducting time series forecasting using the ARIMA model. The analysis is based on the "Gold Rate History in Tamil Nadu (2006-2020)" dataset from Kaggle.

## Introduction:
The aim of this project is to provide insights into the gold market in Tamil Nadu from 2006 to 2020. Through various data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and make predictions that can help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes the historical gold rates in Tamil Nadu from 2006 to 2020.

## Market Basket Analysis
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to discover patterns in large datasets. In this project, we explore the purchasing behavior of gold by analyzing transaction data.

### Key Steps:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Generating Association Rules
+ Analyzing Frequent Itemsets

## Recommendation Systems
### Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation method based on user-item interactions. It predicts user preferences for items by finding similarities between users or items.

#### Key Steps:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Building User-Item Interaction Matrix
+ Implementing Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
+ Evaluating the Model

### Content-Based Filtering
Content-Based Filtering recommends items based on the attributes of items and user profiles. It uses the properties of items and the history of user interactions to suggest new items.

#### Key Steps:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Extracting Features
+ Building and Evaluating the Recommendation Model

## Time Series Forecasting
### ARIMA Model
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular statistical method used for time series forecasting. It captures the autocorrelations in the data.

### Key Steps:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
+ Building the ARIMA Model
+ Forecasting Future Gold Rates
